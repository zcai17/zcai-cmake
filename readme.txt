all these files are under the tutorial_sim folder, I didn't upload the build folder since I remember we only need to 'cmake ..' after we create and enter that folder.

the content is the same as the professor Mustafa wrote in his geant4 tutorials, the link is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KEB-ZrWvQ0&list=PLLybgCU6QCGWgzNYOV0SKen9vqg4KXeVL&index=7

the last file: sim_temp.cc can be ignored since we should keep only one main() in the  folder.

the problem is every time I run the interface, it looks like overload and stop responding, the corresponding part I'm trying to do is in tutorial-7, about 24:30.

the detector files are for virtual detectors, the construction files are to give geometry, the physics files are to get us the physics list, the action and generator files are to give particle guns.
